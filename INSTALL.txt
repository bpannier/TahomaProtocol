Dependencies
============
The only external package dependency is 'requests', to avoid some warnings under Python 2.x you also install
requests[security].

pip install 'requests[security]'

alternatively to the security package you might try to downgrade requests package.

WARNING this has not been tested:
pip install requests==2.5.3
